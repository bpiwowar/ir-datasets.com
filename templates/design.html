<p>
    This document summarises the design decisions and reasoning of <kbd>ir_datasets</kbd>.
</p>

<h2 class="underline">Why Python?</h2>

<p>
    Python was a natural choice for building <kbd>ir_datasets</kbd>.
    Python is the language of choice for much of the recent work in Information Retrieval (particularly
    work that uses deep neural networks).
    Python also already has a rich ecosystem of software packages, giving <kbd>ir_datasets</kbd> easy
    access to a variety of development and runtime tools.
    Finally, Python has a realatiely simple syntax and code structure, simplifying the develoment and
    maintenance of the package.
</p>

<p>
    The decision to build this library with Python isn't without its downsides, however. Processing
    some data formats are slow in Python and require building specialised Python extensions to
    handle them efficiently (e.g., <a href="https://github.com/seanmacavaney/pyautocorpus">pyautocorpus</a>
    was built to take advantage of a fast c-based library for extracting the text from Wikipedia markup.)
</p>

<h2 class="underline">Why NamedTuples?</h2>

<p>
    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.NamedTuple"><kbd>NamedTuple</kbd></a>s are
    used as the core data objects in <kbd>ir_datasets</kbd>. These objects are fast, lightweight, immutable, and
    reasonably self-documenting. Further, since it's part of the Python Standard Library, it does not introduce
    any dependencies.
</p>

<p>
    NamedTuples are also very flexible, and can easily be convered into a variety of formats:
</p>

${hl('''
import ir_datasets
dataset = ir_datasets.load('antique')
doc = dataset.docs.lookup('1424320_8')

# To a tuple:
tuple(doc)
# ('1424320_8', 'As others pointed out, there are[SNIP]cash.. . Regards.')

# To a dict:
doc._asdict()
# {'doc_id': '1424320_8', 'text': 'As others pointed out, there are[SNIP]cash.. . Regards.'}

# To a Pandas Dataframe:
import pandas as pd
pd.DataFrame(dataset.docs)
#            doc_id                                               text
# 0       2020338_0  A small group of politicians believed strongly...
# 1       2020338_1             Because there is a lot of oil in Iraq.
# ...           ...                                                ...

<p>
    Before going with NamedTuples, we also considered several other approachs for data objects:
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Why not <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html">dataclass</a>?</strong>
    The recently-added Python dataclasses provide much of the same functionality as NamedTuple.
    However, they come with some drawbacks
    They are generally <a href="https://death.andgravity.com/namedtuples"> slower than NamedTuples</a>
    (though starting in Python 3.10, <kbd>slots=True</kbd> can help with some operations).
    NamedTuples allow for easier transformation into other common types, including dicts and tuples.
    This can be particularly helpful for reducing storage overhead (e.g., the docstore for msmarco-passage is 23%
    smaller because the contents are encoded as NamedTuples, rather than dataclasses).
    Since they were only first introduced in python 3.7, they are incompatible with the popular 3.6 release.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Why not <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries"><kbd>dict</kbd></a>?</strong>
    Dictionary objects are popular choices easy, ad hoc data records, since they can be easily created, extended,
    and serialised into formats like JSON.
    However, they do not provide a clear and fixed definition of the available fields, so a separate definition
    structure would need to be provided for information like the type of each field.
    They are also larger in memory and operations such as looking up items by field are also slower than NamedTuple.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Why not <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/pythontutorial">protobuf</a>?</strong>
    Protocol Buffers are a serialisation format allowing data to be shared across systems and platforms.
    The Python binding provides much of the same functionality as NamedTuples, with the added benefit of a well-defined
    serialisation format.
    However, they introduce a relatively large dependency and would add non-trivial complexity to the
    build process (e.g., protobufs need to be compiled to generate the corresponding Python code).
    They also do not convert as easily to other formats (e.g., Pandas treats them as object types by default,
    rather than expanding a column out for each field).
    Per our benchmarking, they are also slightly slower to read from disk, compared to our approach with NamedTuples.
</p>


<h2 class="underline">Why LZ4?</h2>

<p>
    The <a href="https://github.com/lz4/lz4">LZ4 compression algorithm</a> is used throughout <kbd>ir_datasets</kbd>
    when data needs to be stored.
    Most notably, data in most docstore objects&mdash;used for looking up documents by ID, iterating quickly, or
    slicing document iterators&mdash;compress document object contents using LZ4 compression.
    We found this compression format preferable to others for a variety of reasons.
    Most importantly, it provides by far the fastest decompression, while providing a reasonable compression rate.
    It also allows for fine-grained control over the output frames, which allows for fast seeking to specific offsets.
    This is helpful for providing functionality like fast document lookups.
    As a bonus, the software package is lighter-weight than other competing compression libraries (e.g., zstandard, snappy).
</p>

<p>
    In some cases, we cannot avoid using other compression techniques. For instance, the ClueWeb datasets would be
    too large and take too long to re-compress as LZ4. To provide fast lookup and fancy slicing functionality
    for these datasets, we built the <a href="https://github.com/seanmacavaney/zlib-state"><kbd>zlib-sate</kbd></a>
    library which allows for more flexible seeking to particular points in gzip files. By distributing files
    that provide periodic checkpoints, efficient corpus processing is provided while managing stoage costs.
